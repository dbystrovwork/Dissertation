# Networks with Complex Weights

Oxford MSc Dissertation - Spectral properties of complex-weighted graphs and applications to Graph Neural Networks.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run structural balance experiment
python experiments/structural_balance.py
```

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Core library code
- `experiments/` - Runnable experiments
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks
- `docs/` - Documentation and notes
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts (including RunPod)

## Key Results

Testing hypothesis: MagNet (complex-weighted GNN) outperforms GCN on structurally unbalanced graphs.
